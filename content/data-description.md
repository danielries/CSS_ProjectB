The data source for this project is The Movie Database (TMDB) from where the most popular actors are found through their "Popular People" page. The Movie Database has a broad coverage of the film industry and it has built a reputation for being a well-known data source within the field. By accessing their API, endless information about the popular actors and their respective movies can be obtained. This data is organized into two primary dataframes; one for the popular actors and one for the all the movies that the popular actors have taken part in. The actor dataframe includes details like age, gender, birthplace etc. and the movie dataframe includes release date, rating, genre etc.
